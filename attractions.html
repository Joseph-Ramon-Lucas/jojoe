            Cute farm with lots of different events going on. Perfect getaway
            from the city with farm animals and veggies around. Wish they didn't
            close the hay rides so early, we didn't get to go :(

            Ice Skating was very fun, despite the fall. Nice atmosphere with
            lots of people. Food options were available. Exciting holiday
            energy. Wish they had better decorations.

            Wet, rainy, and most of the time, we couldn't even see because of
            people's umbrellas everywhere. We had attended the first ever Rocky
            Day officiated by the city of Philadelphia on December 3rd, 2023.
            Horrible weather but it was unique at least- got to see Sylvester
            Stallone in person and listen to a lot of speeches but towards the
            end, we just wanted to dry off and get warm.

            Cool, easy to get in, nice bell. Free &amp; simple and yet very
            historic.

            Best Night Ever! &amp; Once In a Lifetime Experience. Very fun
            concert with a vibrant crowd. I felt so happy to see my favorite
            band in person. Listening to these songs in person was out of this
            world. Happy to bring Joe along for his cultural expansion journey
            (someone spoke to Joe in Spanish).

            This was a fun detour. The SIG marathon had been canceled, hence our
            green t-shirts â€¦ so we had nothing to do. We entered for free. I
            liked the areas where we could sit and sketch. I was a little
            underwhelmed by the size of the collection but not by the quality.
            Every piece was interesting to read about. We personally mimicked
            some of the hand statues for example. I liked the outside too, the
            famous Gates of Hell looked cool. Very fun day and I didn't get
            tired of walking around the exhibit since it was smaller.

            Very fun haunted houses! Very immersive because the actors can touch
            you. Lol. We got separated in one haunted house which was funny. To
            end the night, Joseph fell on the ground after being shot at by air
            pressure. Funny!!! I felt like I was in a movie set
