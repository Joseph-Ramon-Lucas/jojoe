            Food was… alright but could have been cooked better. Chicken Marsala
            was a bit dry and I would've liked it if it was creamier. Our waiter
            took too long to tend to us between orders and when picking up our
            check. Not as cozy as I remembered and I felt disappointed after. At
            least their portions were big and filling.

            I had the chicken gyro. It was O.K. Would I get it again? Only if I
            was super hungry. The chicken was soft, but the overall gyro needed
            more toppings. It was too simple. Only had lettuce, tomato, and
            onions. So to me it lacked taste. Was o.k. But something was
            missing.

            Relatively inexpensive Mexican and Central American food. Tasty and
            filling with lots of flavor. Meats are very tender and juicy while
            the tortillas and flour pancakes are very crispy and crunchy.
            Lettuce is fresh and the sauce is good.

            Decently priced soups with large portion sizes. The broths used are
            always full of rich meaty and bone flavor combined with the tangy
            citrus tastes that complement the rest of the soup ingredients. Just
            wish the meat were more tender sometimes.

            The tacos are alright. They are tasty, but not very authentic.
            Ingredients and toppings could be more embedded within each other…
            lol. Seems a little synthetic and needs more warmth if that makes
            sense. The fajita bowl was much better. The meat was tasty and the
            tostada that acted as the bowl added a unique Mexican taste to the
            food.

            Good enough to return and keep shopping for the ambience, but not
            good enough to love and rejoice right after you have their products.
            Vibe at the place is also a bit hectic. Full of people working on
            their laptops creates a sense of stress rather than relaxation.
            Sometimes the customers flirt with the baristas and sometimes the
            baristas flirt back- this makes the atmosphere more interesting to
            listen to. Lattes are nothing special, they're just alright. Perhaps
            a bit too sugary.

            Too overpriced. Coffee quality is definitely higher, but not worth
            it to pay 8 dollars for a small cup of coffee. Not worth it at all!

            Portion Size felt slightly small to me but they had made the food
            taste really nice. The soup was the perfect compliment to the rainy
            day we had visited on and the tea was the cherry on top. Cozy
            atmosphere with wooden decorations and instant attentive service
            made us want to recreate the experience.

            I went here in the past during my freshman year at Drexel and I
            remember this restaurant being great. However, this time, it didn't
            feel the same. The food didn't feel very flavorful- I expected a
            more saucy taste from the authentic dish I ordered (Unless that's
            what it means to be authentic) and even the corn soup wasn't very
            creamy, just eggy. Our server wasn't well versed in English so he
            didn't understand what I was asking sometimes. When we ordered tea,
            we expected a hot kettle but instead got a cold can of tea, which
            was not the mood. I felt like they could've given us a better idea
            of what we were getting before we ordered. I definitely felt like I
            misled Johanna into thinking the place was good. (oops)

            I was not impressed with the food. Everyone else looked better. I
            feel like I could've made that egg mix I got at home. Adding the
            french fries with ketchup on my breakfast meal seemed a little off
            too. Joe's waffles were great though, sadly not the chicken tenders
            that they go with. It could be better or we could also try a new
            thing on their menu. Joe looked cute at the restaurant though.
