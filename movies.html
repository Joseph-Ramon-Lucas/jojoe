            Suspenseful with a mystery. The twist ending mid way through
            exposing another Simulated world turned the movie around and made it
            more interesting.

            Made us feel more connected to Philadelphia. We enjoyed seeing the
            love story between Rocky and Adrian. Got inspired to be cool like
            Rocky. We had green spaghetti as we watched it which made it better.

            Cheesy scary movie. The storyline wasn't that good. There wasn't a
            main character it felt like. Not very scary and kind of predictable.

            Gory scary movie lacking a strong storyline. So random: cancer,

            Very sexual movie with an interesting but strange plot related to
            cult gatherings. Lots of scenes stretched on for a long time making
            the pacing extremely slow and totaling the movie runtime to over 2
            and a half hours! At least the music score was very good. A mix
            unique chanting with string orchestration,

          <td>
            Very suspenseful film that kept expanding with mystery and
            unanswered questions. At first, the problem is on the two people who
            visit the house, but then it shifts to more than that. The
            overwhelming apocalyptic undertone shifts the movie away from a
            simple home intrusion movie which is an amazing way to keep the plot
            interesting and always moving. The ending felt confusing with lots
            of different events occurring yet not feeling like they've
            concluded. Overall, it's done very well

            Very predictable and quite corny at times with the exaggerated
            actions that the husband got into. The whole premise of starting
            from nothing and lying your way until you become unfathomably
            successful is an interesting concept but can get very stale. It was
            interesting to see how far it would go but after a while I just
            wanted the movie to end.

          <td>
            Very serious movie where a young law graduate starts his career at a
            firm but learns how sketchy they are. It was interesting to see how
            the characters became more familiar with the people they worked
            with. Although slow at first, the intensity ramps up as our main
            character does some nefarious acts and tries to escape from the job
            he originally praised. Most of the characters were a bit
            creepy/exaggerated but the resolution to fix the main problem was a
            clever idea. Sometimes a bit hard to follow since the plot got very
            complicated.
